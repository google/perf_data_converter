quipper is a library to read linux kernel perf data.

After parsing a perf.data file it can convert it to a protobuf for further
manipultation.

It can also do other things like remap addresses preserving shared-object
offsets, garbage-collect MMAP events, etc.

To build without the ChromeOS chroot:
1. Install pre-requisites. install_prerequisites.sh does this for you.
2. Build using make -f Makefile.external.
